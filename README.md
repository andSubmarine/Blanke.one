## Hello and welcome to the github repos for my website! 

I primarily use this repository to keep track of changes to my website, but also to offer anyone what are into web development to have the oppuninity to take a look behind the scenes and see what's it's all about. My website isn't too fancy and doesn't really utilize any particular frameworks. The only exception is [Bootstrap v 3.3](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/) which helps make my website more responsive to different screen sizes (although you can come a long way with media queries etc.).

Some of the most interesting parts of this website, that you could check out is the following files:
* [sendMail.php](https://github.com/andSubmarine/Blanke.one/blob/master/sendMail.php): php script that sends an email based on three variables 
* [index.html](https://github.com/andSubmarine/Blanke.one/blob/master/index.html): Website front page - take a look at the email modal, some of the featurerettes or the social media lineup!
* [terminal.html](https://github.com/andSubmarine/Blanke.one/blob/master/projects/terminal.html): small project with a website terminal component

Check it for yourself - right [here](https://blanke.one/index.html)!
