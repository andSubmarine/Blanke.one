### Hello and welcome to the github repos for my website! 

I primarily use this repository to keep track of changes to my website, but also to offer anyone what are into web development to have the oppuninity to take a look behind the scenes and see what's it's all about. My website isn't too fancy and doesn't really utilize any particular frameworks. The only exception is [Bootstrap v 3.3](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/) which helps make my website more responsive to different screen sizes (although you can come a long way with media queries etc.).

Check it for yourself - right [here](https://blanke.one/index.html)!
